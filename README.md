# ScummVM Game Icons

This repository contains icons of [ScummVM-supported games](https://www.scummvm.org/compatibility/) for features like:

- Discord rich presence
- Taskbar integration

Or just plain old shortcuts.

## Contributing

Check the [Table of Contents](TOC.md) to see what icons we're missing. This covers every stable ScummVM game, so prioritize mainstream titles over minor fan games and tech demos.

Just send us a [pull request](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-icons/pulls) with new icons, or put them in an [issue](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-icons/issues) if Git's not your thing (you can attach files to issues via drag'n'drop). Be sure to update the TOC when you do.

Icons should follow this format:

- PNG format with alpha transparency.
- 512x512 size.
- `<engine>-<game>.png` filename.

Variants of the same game can have the same icon. For engines with lots of games (eg. Wintermute, Glk) it might be better to have a generic `<engine>.png` icon to cover all the games.
